# wordpress-lti-platform

The LTI specifications from [IMS Global](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) provide a seamless and secure mechanism for making connections between a platform (such as an VLE/LMS) and a tool (such as a textbook on a publisher's site or a quiz engine).  This plugin enables WordPress to act as an LTI Platform and allow links to LTI tools to be embedded into pages within a site.
